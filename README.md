# WeatherWidget

Simply a small weather widget showing current and the next ~20 hours of weather forecast in 3 hour intervals.

This widget uses weather data and icons from OpenWeatherMap.

### Possible improvements:
* Option to choose between fahrenheit and celcius.
* Option to choose the length of time intervals between forecasts. (For example to increase the time interval into a full day.)
* Some layout tweaking.
* Custom colour schemes and symbols for every type of weather.
